# Housing Prices Prediction

# Executive Summary

The goal for this project is to forecast the **Final House Sale Price** in a neighborhood using the most recent six months of sales records for the area. The final selected model (**Random Forest Regressor**) provides a **91.2%** prediction accuracy of the house price, with a +/- **$48317** price range variation. The **Number of Bathrooms** feature has the **highest impact** on the house price. I hypothesized that this feature might be highly correlated to the number of rooms, which is a better price indicator compared to the square footage of the house. In addition, an **explanatory model** was created to provide insights on each individual feature.
